						<h5><b>Referral Link</b>&nbsp;<small>Use this Referral link to earn some cash</small></h5> 
                        <p>Earn $10 for every order made with your referral link.Refer as many people as possible</p>
						<p>This is how this referral link works.Refer Someone into our website and get $10 every time your link is used to make the first order.If someone click on your link multiple times, our system will record only the first insatance and the other instances will be ignored</P>
						<h5>What's referral link and how does it work?</h5>
						<p>Referral link is a module in Upwrites.net that rewards people for referring clients into our website.A bonus of $10 is  credit on your account for every  succefull refarral that has made order into our system</p>
						<p>As soon as one enters into our website through your link, a cookie is created and saved in database.Even if the referred clears the cookies,you will still get your bonus, since that refaral is still recorded in the database.</p>
						<p>Refered can make an order years after referring them,you will still get your bonus , because we have the records in the system.</p>
						<h5>What if someone uses my link and does not order and goes back and uses someone else link, will i benefit?</h5>
						<p>Yeah, if you are the first person to refer that user, you will get a commission when they make their first order.It does not matter how many referal link they click, the first referal link wins, since they knew the system through the first referral link.</p>
						<h5>Can i click on my own referral link?</h5>
						<p>You can do that for fun , your own referral link has no effect.</p>
						<h5>Where can i see my referral link analysis?</h5>
						<p> From your dashboard, click on the referral section.</p>
						<h5>I referred someone but the refarral data did not reflect? </h5>
						<p>This is because that person was referred by another person .That means the person already knows our websie through another referral link,so your reffeeral link will be ignored and reward the first person to reffer them.</p>
